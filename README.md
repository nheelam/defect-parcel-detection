# defect-parcel-detection
Create an object detection system that can distinguish between good (condition) and defective parcels using the object detection algorithms, Yolov5 and Yolov7.

# 1. Introduction
In today's tech-driven world, manual inspection of parcels in delivery companies remains a common practice, despite the advancements in technology. The condition of a parcel holds significant importance for delivery companies, as a high rate of defective parcels can tarnish their reputation and deter customers. With intense competition in the market, maintaining a good reputation in handling parcels is crucial for remaining the preferred logistic partner for e-commerce businesses. Manual identification of package damage is time-consuming and costly, involving visual inspections, photography, and documentation. To address these challenges, automating parcel detection using object detection algorithms like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 is proposed, aiming to distinguish between good and defective parcels. The effectiveness and drawbacks of each algorithm are evaluated using metrics such as mAP, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, offering a potential solution to enhance reporting quality, speed up receipt processing, and reduce reliance on manual labor in the delivery industry.

# 2. Objective
1. To build an object detection system that can detect good (condition) parcels and defect
parcels. In this project, Yolov5 and Yolov7 are used as object detection algorithms to identify
good and defective parcels. <br>
2. To reduce the amount of time spent evaluating parcels. With the automated approach
introduced in this paper, delivery companies can streamline the parcel examination process
and save time, as well as reduce manpower needed in the operation. <br>
3. To compare and contrast between YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 algorithmsâ€™ performance in
detecting parcel conditions. The evaluation metrics such as mean average precision (mAP),
precision, recall, and confusion matrix are assessed, together with their respective advantages
and disadvantages. <br>
